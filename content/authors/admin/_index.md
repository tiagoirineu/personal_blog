My original goal was to become a researcher, but after I completed my master's studies I had to begin to work. Regardless of this, I want to be a life-long learner, and in this site I will share what I'm learning. Right now my focus is learning data analysis and visualization using R. After acquiring proficiency in R and analytics, I will move to Python in Machine Learning. 

In the medium term, I hope to be working in a quantitative position where I can apply these skills and critical thinking to real-world problems. In the long term, I hope to create something that positively impact the life of others. For me, to help people to grow is our most important endeavor.
