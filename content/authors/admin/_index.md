Hello, I am Tiago Irineu, this guy in the picture. Greetings from Brazil.

I'm a master in Economics and I love to study and try to understand how society works. My original goal was to get a PhD to become a researcher and professor. But, after I completed my master's studies I had to change plans and begin to work. Regardless of this, I want to be a life-long learner, and in this site I will share what I am currently studying. Right now my focus is learning data analysis and visualization using R. After mastering this, I will move to Python and Machine Learning.

In the medium term, I hope to be working in a quantitative position where I can apply these skills and critical thinking to real-world problems. In the long term, I hope to create something that positively impact the life of others. For me, to help people to grow is our most important endeavor.
