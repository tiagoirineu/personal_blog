Hello, I'm Tiago.

I'm a master in Economics and currently work as an FX Risk Analyst.

Right now I'm studying Financial Risk Management and R. Besides that, I'm interested in Statistics, modeling, and communication.

*I built this site using the package blogdown in RStudio.*
*If you also want to build a site using R, you can find a good tutorial [here](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/).*
