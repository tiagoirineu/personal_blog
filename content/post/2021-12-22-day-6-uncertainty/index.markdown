### Uncertainty - day 6

#### Reflection

When we are reading a plot we expect that every element in the chart is represent one aspect of the data. The problem with adding uncertainty to our plots is that most of the time it is not obvious to the reader what we are representing, given that the uncertainty is not a direct representation of the data.

Take for example the needle movement in the [New York Time's election dial](https://flowingdata.com/2016/11/15/showing-uncertainty-during-the-live-election-forecast/). For a reader, a possible interpretation was that it was moving given the arrival of live data. But this was not the case. It was just a random movement intended to show the uncertainty related to any forecast. But instead of informing people about the inherent uncertainty, it created anxiety and confusion.

It is important to be careful when trying to show uncertainty in our plots because uncertainty and randomness are not concepts that humans easily grasp. It is our obligation to not mislead our readers showing more confidence in some data than it is warranted, but when doing this we must consider the difficulty of perception that human have. Or we may end up building plots that create more confusion than inform the reader.
